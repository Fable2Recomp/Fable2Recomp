# Fable2Recomp

**Fable2Recomp** is a recompilation Project with hopes to port the game Fable 2 to Windows and Linux. It uses a static recompilation approach based on the Xenia Canary project, streamlining the process and fixing various issues that may arise during decompilation and recompilation.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for ease of use.
- Plans for enhancing the game with high-resolution support up to 1080p, 2K, 4K, and beyond.
- Plans for improving the frame rate to 60fps and beyond, reaching up to 240fps.
- Enhanced graphics for a superior gaming experience.

## Issues

### Unrecognized Instruction
During the recompilation process, you might encounter "Unrecognized instruction" errors. These need to be implemented into XenonRecomp to fully fix these files. This ensures that the recompilation process is accurate and complete.

## Seeking Help
I need assistance with:
1. Implementing unrecognized instructions into XenonRecomp.
2. Locating JumpTables in Ghidra using an uncompressed XEX file.

## How to Build an exe from the cpp code
```
clang -o output.exe ppc_func_mapping.cpp ppc_recomp.*.cpp -std=c++20 -O2 -mssse3 -msse4.1 -mavx -MP -pthread
```

I am looking for help and I am willing to learn coding and help where I can, but I am also open to others joining the project and teaching me if possible. If you have experience or are willing to learn and help out, your support would be greatly appreciated. Iâ€™m eager to enhance the game with high-resolution support, improved frame rates, and enhanced graphics.
